# tableau
Module 18 Challenge

This repository contains the analysis for the Tableau visualizations. CSV files were not included due to their size limitations..
These CSV files were pulled from the CitiBike resource located here:

https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data
"202201-citibike-tripdata"
"202206-citbike-tripdata"
"202209-citibike-tripdata"

CSV files for 2022 in the months of January, June, and September were cleaned of null values and duplicates, then combined into a single CSV file named "citibike2022". This allowed filters to be used to compare and contrast months throughout 2022, but it also created a severe strain on the user's personal computer because of the amount of data and graphical processing power needed for the maps. Visualizations took at least 30 seconds and sometimes 2 minutes to update views.
